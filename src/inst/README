InstSrc Implementation

InstSrc is the installation source, i.e. any provider of
installation data (selections, packages, patches).

This data resides on a media.

InstSrc uses MediaAccess (see media/ directory) for access
to the media.

In order to minimize real media access (which might be costly
for ftp access), InstSrc abstracts away from the physical media
and tries to cache meta-information about the media contents.

This allows the packagemanager to handle media contents without
actually accessing the media for most of the usual tasks. It's up
to the InstSrc to decide which information to cache and which
information to retrieve from the media.

In order to handle multiple installation sources in parallel, the
installation source manager (InstSrcMgr) keeps track of 'known'
sources and their cached meta-information.

* InstSrc meta-information

- url		string, specifies access data for MediaAccess
- enabled	bool, a source might be temporarely disabled but still known
		to the manager
- priority	int, used to prefer sources, i.e. patch-server before cd
- cost		int, cost of access
- checksig	bool, if signatures are to be checked (GPG key known)
- mirror	string, filename of real url (for mirrors)
- label		string, user defined label
- MediaInfo	see MediaInfo (product, version, vendor, architectures, ...)
