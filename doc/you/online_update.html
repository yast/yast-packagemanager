<h1>YaST Online Update</h1>

<em>This document applies to the online update since SuSE Linux 8.1/SLES 8.
Changes in later versions are explicitely marked.</em>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The online update has a patch structure. Each patch has a patch description
file and n RPM packages.


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>YOU uses the information about the name, version and base architecture of the installed
products to determine the paths for downloading patch descriptions and RPMs from the server
and for caching these files on the local system.</p>


<h3>Box Product OR Business Produkt?</h3>

<p>If a product has not the name "SuSE-Linux" it is considered as a business product and
slightly different paths and server URLs apply.</p>


<h3>Paths to the patch data</h3>

<p>The paths to the patch data consist of a base URL or a local base path, a product
dependend path and a path depending on the type of data (i.e. descriptions, RPMs and
script).

<h4>Download URLs</h4>

<p>The download base URLs are determined by reading a list of URLs from the URL
<tt>http://www.suse.de/cgi-bin/suseservers.cgi</tt> by default. This URL can be overridden
by a product-specific URL by the creator of the product (see media specification). In a
running system the URL used for getting the list of YOU servers is saved in the file
<tt>/var/adm/YaST/ProdDB/prod_00000001</tt> or in the file with the highest number, if there
is more than one.</p>

<p>The list is stored locally at <tt>/var/lib/YaST2/you/youservers</tt> since SL
8.2 (8.1 used the location <tt>/etc/suseservers</tt>). If the variable
<tt>YAST2_LOADFTPSERVER</tt> in the file <tt>/etc/sysconfig/onlineupdate</tt> is
set to <tt>no</tt>, the server isn't contacted and the download base URLs are
read from the local file <tt>/etc/youservers</tt> (8.1 used the location
<tt>/etc/suseservers</tt>).</p>

<p>The default download base URLs are <tt>ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/</tt> for the box
product and <tt>http://sdb.suse.de/download/</tt> for the business products.</p>

<h4>Local Path</h4>

<p>Downloaded files are stored locally under the directory
<tt>/var/lib/YaST2/you/</tt>. The description files for installed patches are
stored at <tt>/var/lib/YaST2/you-installed</tt>. There is no product specific
path added to the path of the installed patches.</p>

<h4>Product dependent paths</h4>

<p>The path to the description files and the other patch data depends on the installed
products. The base path is <tt>&lt;basearch&gt;/update/&lt;version&gt;</tt> for the box
product, and <tt>&lt;basearch&gt;/update/&lt;productname&gt;/&lt;version&gt;</tt> for the
business products. <tt>&lt;version&gt</tt> is the version of the installed product.
<tt>&lt;productname&gt;</tt> is the name of the installed product.</p>

<p>The different components of the path like description, RPMs and scripts use
different subdirectories of this path.</p>

<h4>Paths to the patch descriptions</h4>

<p>The description files are located in the directory <tt>patches</tt>.

<p>Example: Patch description files for the 8.1. box product for i386 are loaded from
<tt>ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/update/8.1/patches/</tt>.</p>


<h4>Path to RPMs</h4>

<p>The RPMs are located in a architecture specific subdirectory of the directory
<tt>rpm</tt>. The filename of the RPM is contructed from the <tt>Filename:</tt> tag of the package
description, an automatically determined architecture and the version and the release from the
<tt>Version:</tt> tag of the package description. For the architecture of the RPM to be installed
the architecture of the corresponding installed RPM is taken. If there is no installed RPM, the
base architecture is used. As a last fallback <tt>noarch</tt> is used.</p>

<p>Example: i586 RPMs for the i386 version of the 8.1. box product are stored to
<tt>/var/lib/YaST2/you/i386/update/8.1/rpm/i586/</tt>.</p>

<h4>RPM file name</h4>

<p>The file name for the RPM which is looked for on the server is constructed from entries
of the <tt>Packages</tt> section of the patch description file as
<tt>&lt;name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.&lt;arch&gt;.rpm</tt>. <tt>&lt;name&gt</tt> is the
value of <tt>Filename:</tt> stripped by the <tt>.rpm</tt> suffix. <tt>&lt;version&gt</tt>
is the value of <tt>Version:</tt>.</p>

<p><tt>&lt;arch&gt</tt> is determined by the installed system. If there already is a
version of the RPM installed on the system, its architecture is used. If not, a list of
compatible architectures is gone through.</p>

<p>If there is a patch RPM present with the name
<tt>&lt;name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.&lt;arch&gt;.patch.rpm</tt> and a previous version of the
package is already installed, the patch RPM is used for the update.</p>

<p>The first RPM matching the criteria which is found on the server is downloaded and
installed.</p>

<p>If the <tt>InstPath:</tt> tag has a non-empty value this value is used as URL to an
external RPM. The RPM file specified by the URL is downloaded and installed. No automatic
processing of download path or file name takes place.</p>

<h4>Path to scripts</h4>

<p>Scripts are located in the directory <tt>scripts</tt>.</p>

<p>Example Scripts belonging to patches for the i386 version of the 8.1. box product are stored to
<tt>/var/lib/YaST2/you/i386/update/8.1/scripts/</tt>.</p>

<a name="extrafiles">
<h4>Extra files</h4>

<p>YOU provides the option to download extra files which aren't RPMs or scripts.
The files are specified by a <a href="#tag_files"><tt>Files</tt> tag</a> in the
patch file. Each file specification consists of an URL where the file is
downloaded from and the size of the file in bytes.</p>

<p>The files are downloaded into a directory <tt>files</tt> under the local path
(usually <tt>/var/lib/YaST2/you/files</tt>). The directory hierachy of the file
on the server is recreated under the <tt>files</tt> directory. For example a
file with the URL <tt>http://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/myfile.txt</tt> is downloaded
to <tt>/var/lib/YaST2/you/files/pub/suse/myfile.txt</tt>.

<h3>Download from the server</h3>

<p>Patch informations are downloaded from the server by reading a file with the name
<tt>directory.3</tt> from the URL constructed from the base URL by adding the product
specific path and the </tt>patches</tt> directory. The <tt>directory.3</tt> file contains a
list of filenames which have to be present in the same directory. Patches are downloaded
and installed in the order of the names in this file.</p>

<p>All files downloaded from the server are checked for valid signatures.</p>

<h4>Multiple products</h4>

<em>Multiple products are supported since 9.1/SLES 9</em>

<p>If more than one product is installed
patches for each product are downloaded and installed. Products are handled in the order of their
installation which goes from the less specific to the more specific one.</p>

<p>Normally there need to be update directories available for all installed
products. If there are no patches for a given product the patch list in the
<tt>directory.3</tt> file has to be empty. If the patch list for a product is
missing YOU reports that as an error and aborts. There are two exceptions to
that rule:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a product is marked with the <tt>noyou</tt> flag in the product content
file (see YaST media specification) it is ignored for the update.</li>
<li>If the <tt>patches</tt> file in the <tt>media.1</tt> directory contains a
list of products (see YaST media specification), only products which are
installed and contained in this list are used for updating. All other products
are ignored.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Patch names and versions</h3>

<p>If the <tt>Patchname:</tt> tag is present its value will be used as name for the patch. If
it is empty or missig the file name of the patch description file is used as name. If the
<tt>Patchversion:</tt> tag is present, its value will be used as version of the patch. If it
is empty or missing the version will be set to "0".</p>

<p>If there is more than one patch with the same name, only the patch with the highest
version will be offered for installation.</p>


<h3><a name="preselection">Which patch will be preselected for installation?</a></h3>

<p>There are some criterions for preselecting patches which will be installed
by YOU:
<ul>
  <li>If there is a patch of kind "YaST2" the newest patch of this kind is
  selected. All other patches are deselected by default.</li>
<!--  <li>The scripted defined in the patchdescription ( flag "Installtrigger" ) 
  returns true.</li>-->
  <li>If no explicit kind is given and no patch of kind "YaST2" is selected all
  patches of the kinds "security", "recommended" and "patchlevel" are considered
  for selection. All other kinds are deselected by default.</li>
  <li>If one or more packages of the patch are installed and have older versions, the patch will
  be selected.</li>
  <li>If one or more packages of the patch are older as the installed package, the patch will not
  be selected, even if other packages of the patch are newer than the installed one.</li>
  <li>If the patch has the attribute "UpdateOnlyNew" set to "true"
  (available since 9.1) the patch is selected if it contains at least one
  package which is newer than on the installed system.</li>
<!--  <li>One or more packages have a flag ( "Category" ) which is a installed package.</li>-->
</ul>

<p>If the flag "UpdateOnlyInstalled" is not defined or is false, ALL packages of
the patch will be installed. If this flag is "true", only packages will be
updated which are already installed unless they have the flag "ForceInstall" set
to "true". The "ForceInstall" flag is supported since 9.1.
</p>

<p>
Since 9.1 there is the patch attribute "UpdateOnlyNew". If this is set to true
only packages are installed which are newer
than the package on the installed system. This means that packages which are in
the same version in the patch as on the system aren't downloaded and installed
again and that
packages whose version in the patch is older than on the installed system aren't
downgraded. It also means that the patch is automatically selected if it
contains at least one package which is newer than on the installed system.
</p>

<h3>Multiple Architectures</h3>

<p>Since 9.1 a patch file can contain multiple variants of the same package in
different architectures. The variant will be chosen which fits best to the
installed system.</p>

<p>The algorithm to select the best variant works as follows: All package
instances of the same name are treated as variants of the same package. Version
and release number are ignored and may be different. If the package is already
installed the variant having the same architecture as the installed package will
be chosen. If no such variant exists, no variant of the package will be chosen
at all. If the package isn't installed, the variant with the best architecture
according to the list of compatible architectures specified by the product and
the actual architecture of the system will be chosen. If the architecture of the
package isn't listed as compatible architecture the package won't be installed.
</p>

<h3>Executing scripts within a patch</h3>

<p>There is the possibility to run scripts while installing packages. The script from the
<tt>Prescript:</tt> tag is executed before the packages are installed. The
script from the <tt>UpdateScript:</tt> tag is executed instead of installing
the packages. The script from the <tt>Postscript:</tt> tag is executed after 
the packages have been installed. The scripts are downloaded from the <tt>scripts</tt> 
subdirectory and stored localy before execution. (Since 10.0)</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>GUI version</h3>

<p>The online update can be started from the YaST2 control center by selecting the corresponding
icon.</p>

<p>The GUI version of the online update can also be started by command line: <tt>yast2
online_update [.url &lt;url&gt;] [.nosigcheck]</tt>. With the <tt>.url</tt> argument the given
URL is selected as source for the patches. If the argument <tt>.nosigcheck</tt> is present the
signatures of the downloaded files aren't checked.</p>


<h3>Command line version</h3>

<p>There is a command line version of YOU which can be used to non-interactively
download an install patches. The command is <tt>online_update</tt>. A short
description of the available options is available by <tt>online_update
--help</tt>. Calling the command without any options will download and install
all available patches relevant to the installed system.</p>


<h2>Patch CD Update</h2>

<p>There is also the possibilty to provide the patches on a CD ROM. 
Insert the CD ROM with the patches and start the "Patch CD update" 
in YaST2 Control Center. This is euivalent to start the online update with the URL
<tt>cd:///</tt>. You can start the Patch CD Update from the command line with <tt>yast2
online_update .cd_default</tt>.</p>

<p>The patch structure and the directories where the patches are located are exactly
the same as on the ftp server.
The path on CD ROM starts with the {ARCHITECTURE} directory,
e.g. the path on ftp server is:
<tt>/pub/suse/{ARCHITECTURE}/update/{SuSE-Version}/patches/*</tt>,
the directory structure on the CD ROM is:
<tt>{ARCHITECTURE}/update/{SuSE-Version}/patches/*</tt>.</p>

<a name="multiple-cd"/>
<h3>Support for Patch CD Updates from multiple CDs</h3>
<p>Since 9.1 YOU supports patch CD updates from more than one CD. This requires
some additional files to identify the CDs and to specify the distribution of
patches on the CDs.</p>

<p>CDs are identified in the same way as installation CDs (see <a
href="media-descr.html">UL Media description</a>) by a file "/media.x/media"
where the x is the actual number of the CD. The media file contains at least two
lines of text which are used as identification of the media set.</p>

<p>Distribution of patches on the CDs is specified by a file
"mediamap" in the "patches" directory. It contains a list of patches together
with the number of the CD which contains the patch. The patch is
listed by its file name the media number follows on the same line separated by a
space. Patches which aren't listed in this file are assumed to be on the same
CD as the last patch listed with a number. The order of patches is
taken from the "directory.3" file.<p>

<p>Example of mediamap file:</p>

<pre>
patch-1 1
patch-5 2
</pre>

<p>All parts of a patch (patch file, packages, scripts and additional files)
have to be on the same CD. All patch CDs have to contain the patch files for all
patches on all CDs. The "directory.3" file is only needed on the first patch CD.
Leaving it out from the other CDs prevents that the patch CD update is started
from another than the first CD which doesn't work.</p>


<h2>Logging</h2>

<p>YOU writes a summary log to <tt>/var/lib/YaST2/you/youlog</tt> since SL
9.1/SLES 9, detailed logs are written to the standard YaST log file
(<tt>/var/log/YaST2/y2log</tt>).<p>

<p>If the environment variable <tt>Y2DEBUG</tt> is set, debug information is
included in the YaST log. For YOU versions between 8.1/SLES8 and 9.0 setting the
environment variable <tt>Y2SLOG_DEBUG</tt> adds additional debug information
from the packagemanager backend. In particular for the 8.1/SLES8 version it's
recommended to set the <tt>Y2SLOG_DEBUG</tt> variable to get meaningful log
information.</p>
