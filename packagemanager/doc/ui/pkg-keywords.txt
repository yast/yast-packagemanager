		    ======================================

Base for pkg keywords can be obtained by:

     rpm -q --requires <pkg> | grep <typical-lib>


UI style:

libkdecore			-> KDE
libqt, but no libkdecore	-> Qt
libgnome*			-> GNOME
libgdk, but no libgnome*	-> GTK
libXm				-> Motif
libXaw				-> Athena

libncurses			-> NCurses
tk				-> Tcl/Tk
/usr/bin/wish			-> Tcl


(see also posting to [research] on 2002-05-21 15:38)

libX11, but none of the above	-> Xlib (XView? Tcl/Tk? static Motif?)

libX11 doesn't say too much - there might be a lot of statically linked libs
involved. All it does say is "this very likely has a GUI".


requires cdrecord or cdrdao	-> CD recording
sane				-> scanner


pkg name "perl-.*"		-> Perl
pkg name "^tk.*"		-> Tcl/Tk


Keywords for licenses:

GPL
BSD
