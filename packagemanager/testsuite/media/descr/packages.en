reverse-polish notation and allows unlimited precision arithmetic.
Macros can also be defined. Normally, dc reads from standard in but
can also read in files specified on the command line. A calculator with
reverse-polish notation saves numbers to a stack. Arguments to
mathematical operations (operands) are "pushed" onto the stack until the
next operator is read in which "pops" its arguments off the stack and
"pushes" its results back onto the stack.

=Pkg: hotplug 2002_04_01 7 i586
=Sum: enables automatic configuration of hotplugged devices
+Des:
Hotplugging is a new feature of Linux, with the goal of letting you plug in new devices and use them immediately. That means that users won't need to learn as much system administration. Systems will at least partially be autoconfiguring themselves. Initially, it includes support for USB and PCI (Cardbus) devices, and can automatically configure network interfaces.

Now that basic USB and Cardbus hotplugging seems to behave properly, upcoming work will likely involve integration with other Linux subsystems such as input, pcmcia_cs, 1394, disk/storage (starting with SCSI), networking, printing, power management such as APM and ACPI, and more. Kernel 2.5 work will improve autoconfiguration support for Linux, likely including more unified support for stable device names and user mode device management tools.

=Pkg: pcmcia 3.2.0 24 i586
=Sum: PCMCIA support for Linux (also needed for kernel 2.4)
+Des:
This package enables the usage of PCMCIA hardware with Linux.
The handling and configuration is described in the manual in chapter 11.
More detailed documentation can be found under
/usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia/ and in some included manpages.
(See "rpm -ql pcmcia | grep man" after installation.)

Since kernel 2.4 there are two pcmcia systems: 'external' and 'kernel'. If you have troubles it can help to switch to the other system. See /usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia/README.SuSE for details.

The program cardinfo is placed in the package pcmcia-cardinfo.

The PCMCIA modules strongly depend on the running kernel. Therefore the modules
are packed with the kernel in the packages k_*.rpm. If you compile your
own kernel you should recompile the pcmcia modules as well. For this install
the package km_pcmci from serie zkm and read its description.

Supported hardware:
Most modern PCMCIA chipsets and cards are supported. A list of
supported chipsets can be found in the PCMCIA-HOWTO under
/usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia/.
In the same directory you can find a file SUPPORTED.CARDS.
We have integrated additional drivers in the PCMCIA package.
See the README.<driver> files for documentation. README.contrib
contains a short summary of these additional drivers.

perl - Practical Extraction and Report Language

Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text
files, extracting information from those text files, and
printing reports based on that information.  It's also a
good language for many system management tasks.  The
language is intended to be practical (easy to use,
efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant,
minimal).

Some of the modules available on CPAN can be found in the "perl" series.

Attention: due to security reasons we disabled the suid bit of
/usr/bin/suidperl.  If you need this feature, please add the following
line to /etc/permissions.local and run SuSEconfig.

=Pkg: xntp 4.1.1 91 i586
=Sum: Network Time Protocol daemon (version 4)
+Des:
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a
computer client or server to another server or reference time source, such
as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides client accuracies
typically within a millisecond on LANs and up to a few tens of milliseconds
on WANs relative to a primary server synchronized to Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC) via a Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for
example. Typical NTP configurations utilize multiple redundant servers and
diverse network paths, to achieve high accuracy and reliability.
Some configurations include cryptographic authentication to prevent
accidental or malicious protocol attacks.

ntpd is an operating system daemon which sets and maintains the system
time-of-day synchronized with Internet standard time servers. ntpd is a
complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but
also retains compatibility with version 3, as defined by RFC-1305, and version
1 and 2, as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively. ntpd does
most computations in 64-bit floating point arithmetic and does relatively
clumsy 64-bit fixed point operations only when necessary to preserve the
ultimate precision, about 232 picoseconds. While the ultimate precision is not
achievable with ordinary workstations and networks of today, it may be
required with future nanosecond CPU clocks and gigabit LANs.

The daemon can operate in any of several modes, including symmetrical
active/passive, client/server broadcast/multicast, and manycast. A
broadcast/multicast or manycast client can discover remote servers, compute
server-client propagation delay correction factors, and configure itself
automatically. This makes it possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without
specifying configuration details specific to the local environment.

Ordinarily, ntpd reads the ntp.conf configuration file at start-up time
to determine the synchronization sources and operating modes. It is also
possible to specify a working, although limited, configuration entirely on the
command line, obviating the need for a configuration file. This may be
particularly appropriate when the local host is to be configured as a
broadcast/multicast client or manycast client, with all peers being determined
by listening to broadcasts at run time.

Various internal ntpd variables can be displayed and configuration options
altered while the daemon is running using the ntpq and ntpdc utility
programs.

=Pkg: SuSEfirewall2 3.0 4 noarch
=Sum: Packetfilter using 2.4 kernel's iptables/netfilter
+Des:
This package is the successor of the SuSEfirewall (firewals) package.
Like SuSEfirewall, SuSEfirewall2 implements a packetfilter to allow
system administrators to protect their computer and network by restricting
the possibilities of other hosts to connect to them. This potentially
saves you from suffering under the design flaws and vulnerabilties
that are found from time to time in various daemons.

Unlike the old ipchains based SuSEfirewall, this version uses the new
iptables/netfilter packet filtering infrastructure that comes with 2.4
kernels. It allows even more flexible rule setup and, specifically, the
creation of a stateful firewall, as it keeps track of connections and 
has the notion of related connections.

Note that for simply protecting a single host from attacks, you're probably
best of using the QUICKMODE feature of SuSEfirewall2 
(FW_QUICKMODE="yes" in /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2) which replaces the old
personal-firewall that came with prior versions of SuSE Linux.

and SDL (and this way all their drivers) and some lowlevel card-specific
drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and Radeon) too! Most of them supports software
or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen. MPlayer supports
displaying through some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the DVB and
DXR3/Hollywood+ ! And what about the nice big antialiased shaded subtitles

=Pkg: dosemu 1.0.2 284 i586
=Sum: The DOS emulator
+Des:
This package allows MS-DOS programs to be started in Linux. A virtual
machine (the DOS box) provides the necessary BIOS functions and emulates
most of the chip devices (e.g. timer, interrupt- and keyboard controler).

Documentation can be found in '/usr/share/doc/packages/dosemu' and in the man
page, as well as in the sources.

Starting with version 1.0.2 DOSEMU configuration files are no longer
below /etc but in the user's HOME directory below ~/dosemu. DOSEMU
does no longer have the SUID bit set, so if you need access to hardware
that requires root privileges, you must run DOSEMU as 'root'.

If you rely on the old configuration scheme, you can get it back
by using 'dosemu.bin' instead of 'dosemu' ('dos' and 'xdos' have
been renamed to 'dosemu' resp. 'xdosemu').

The parameter $_hogthreshold in '~/dosemu/conf/dosemu.conf' defines how often
an 'idling' DOSEMU should return the CPU to Linux and its default value
'(1)' means 'all power to Linux'. The higher this value is, the more
more CPU power is dedicated to DOSEMU. The value '(0)' disables this
feature completely, hence: 'all power to DOSEMU'. If that isn't fast enough,
you (running UID root) can get maximum performance with

nice -19 dos -D-a 2>/dev/null

Don't be surprised though if the other Linux processes then run very
sluggishly.

On sensitive systems you _never_ should offer a suid-root DOSEMU world
readable, because even if the '$_secure' option in dosemu.conf is set,
its not avoidable that some DPMI-clients (most likely Dos4gw based ones)
may succeed in accessing the whole user space (including DOSEMU code)
and thus gain root access. A comfortable solution is to have two copies
of the DOSEMU binary, a non-suid-root one for world access and a
suid-root one (protected by file permissions) only available to trusted
users.
-Des:
+Ins:
Starting with version 1.0.2, config files are no longer below /etc
but individually for every user in ~/dosemu/conf. Note that
'dos' and 'xdos' have been renamed to 'dosemu' resp. 'xdosemu'.

The directory xmlwf contains the xmlwf application, which uses the
xmlparse library. The arguments to xmlwf are one or more files which are
each to be checked for well-formedness. An option -d dir can be
specified; for each well-formed input file the corresponding canonical
XML will be written to dir/f, where f is the filename (without any path)
of the input file. A -x option will cause references to external general
entities to be processed. A -s option will make documents that are not
standalone cause an error (a document is considered standalone if either
it is intrinsically standalone because it has no external subset and no
references to parameter entities in the internal subset or it is
declared as standalone in the XML declaration).

=Pkg: jpeg 6b 447 src
=Sum: Independent JPEG Group's JPEG Software
+Des:
Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression. JPEG
pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for
full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
"real-world" scenes (most of the time there are pictures that have
been scanned-in with a scanner). Cartoons and other non-realistic images
are not its strong suit. You should note that the output of JPEG is not
necessarily the same as its input. If this is a factor for you, then
don't use it. With typical real-world scenes, JPEG can achieve
high compression rates, without noticeable differences. If
you can accept pictures of lower quality, JPEG can achieve amazingly
high compression rates.

There are some library functions available for reading and writing
JPEG files. The 'cjpeg' and 'djpeg' applications use the library to
make conversions between JPEG and other popular graphics file formats
possible. The library is meant to be used within other applications.

Cjpeg compresses the input file, or standard input if no filename
was given, and produces a JPEG/JFIF to standard output. Currently
supported input file formats include: PPM (PBMPLUS color format),
PGM (PBMPLUS Grayscale format), BMP, GIF, Targa and RLE (Utah Raster
Toolkit Format). (RLE is only supported if the RLE library is
available.) Djpeg decompresses a JPEG file in one of the above
mentioned formats.

=Pkg: samba 2.2.5 46 src
=Sum: An SMB file server for Unix
+Des:
Samba is a suite of programs which work together to allow clients to access Unix filespace and printers via the SMB protocol (Server Message Block).

In practice, this means that you can redirect disks and printers to
Unix disks and printers from LAN Manager clients, Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 clients, Windows'95 clients, Windows NT clients
and OS/2 clients. There is also a Unix client program supplied as part of the suite which allows Unix users to use an ftp-like interface to access filespace and printers on any other SMB server.

Samba includes the following programs (in summary):

* smbd, the SMB server. This handles actual connections from clients.

* nmbd, the Netbios name server, which helps clients locate servers.

* smbclient, the Unix-hosted client program.

* smbrun, a little 'glue' program to help the server run external programs.

* testprns, a program to test server access to printers.

* testparm, a program to test the Samba configuration file for correctness.

* smb.conf, the Samba configuration file.

* smbprint, a sample script to allow a Unix host to use smbclient
  to print to an SMB server.

The suite is supplied with full source and is GPLed.

This package expects its config file under /etc/samba/smb.conf.
