reverse-polish notation and allows unlimited precision arithmetic.
Macros can also be defined. Normally, dc reads from standard in but
can also read in files specified on the command line. A calculator with
reverse-polish notation saves numbers to a stack. Arguments to
mathematical operations (operands) are "pushed" onto the stack until the
next operator is read in which "pops" its arguments off the stack and
"pushes" its results back onto the stack.

Hotplugging is a new feature of Linux, with the goal of letting you plug in new devices and use them immediately. That means that users won't need to learn as much system administration. Systems will at least partially be autoconfiguring themselves. Initially, it includes support for USB and PCI (Cardbus) devices, and can automatically configure network interfaces.

Now that basic USB and Cardbus hotplugging seems to behave properly, upcoming work will likely involve integration with other Linux subsystems such as input, pcmcia_cs, 1394, disk/storage (starting with SCSI), networking, printing, power management such as APM and ACPI, and more. Kernel 2.5 work will improve autoconfiguration support for Linux, likely including more unified support for stable device names and user mode device management tools.

=Pkg: jpeg 6b 437 i586
=Sum: Independent JPEG Group's JPEG Software
+Des:
Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression. JPEG
pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for
full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
"real-world" scenes (most of the time there are pictures that have
been scanned-in with a scanner). Cartoons and other non-realistic images
are not its strong suit. You should note that the output of JPEG is not
necessarily the same as its input. If this is a factor for you, then
don't use it. With typical real-world scenes, JPEG can achieve
high compression rates, without noticeable differences. If
you can accept pictures of lower quality, JPEG can achieve amazingly
high compression rates.

There are some library functions available for reading and writing
JPEG files. The 'cjpeg' and 'djpeg' applications use the library to
make conversions between JPEG and other popular graphics file formats
possible. The library is meant to be used within other applications.

Cjpeg compresses the input file, or standard input if no filename
was given, and produces a JPEG/JFIF to standard output. Currently
supported input file formats include: PPM (PBMPLUS color format),
PGM (PBMPLUS Grayscale format), BMP, GIF, Targa and RLE (Utah Raster
Toolkit Format). (RLE is only supported if the RLE library is
available.) Djpeg decompresses a JPEG file in one of the above
mentioned formats.

lightweight (no databases needed) lpr, lpc, and lprm programs; dynamic
redirection of print queues; automatic job holding; highly verbose
diagnostics; multiple printers serving a single queue; and a greatly
improved permission and authorization mechanism.

LPRng provides emulation packages for the SVR4 lp and lpstat programs,
eliminating the need for another print spooler package. These emulation
packages can be modified according to local requirements, in order to
support vintage printing systems.

Attention: Interoperability with older LPD implementations
requires privileged access to ports.  Therefore all affected
client-programs ship with SUID root priviledges!

The handling and configuration is described in the manual in chapter 11.
More detailed documentation can be found under
/usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia/ and in some included manpages.
(See "rpm -ql pcmcia | grep man" after installation.)

Since kernel 2.4 there are two pcmcia systems: 'external' and 'kernel'. If you have troubles it can help to switch to the other system. See /usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia/README.SuSE for details.

The program cardinfo is placed in the package pcmcia-cardinfo.

The PCMCIA modules strongly depend on the running kernel. Therefore the modules
are packed with the kernel in the packages k_*.rpm. If you compile your
own kernel you should recompile the pcmcia modules as well. For this install
the package km_pcmci from serie zkm and read its description.

Supported hardware:
Most modern PCMCIA chipsets and cards are supported. A list of
supported chipsets can be found in the PCMCIA-HOWTO under
/usr/share/doc/packages/pcmcia/.
In the same directory you can find a file SUPPORTED.CARDS.
We have integrated additional drivers in the PCMCIA package.
See the README.<driver> files for documentation. README.contrib
contains a short summary of these additional drivers.

good language for many system management tasks.  The
language is intended to be practical (easy to use,
efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant,
minimal).

Some of the modules available on CPAN can be found in the "perl" series.

Attention: due to security reasons we disabled the suid bit of
/usr/bin/suidperl.  If you need this feature, please add the following

'sudo' is a command that allows users to execute some commands as
root. The /etc/sudoers file (edited with 'visudo') specifies which
users have access to sudo and which commands they can run. 'sudo' logs
all its activities to syslogd, so the system administrator can
keep an eye on things. Sudo asks for the password for initializing a
check period of a given time N (where N is defined at installation and
is set to 5 minutes by default).

=Pkg: susewm 3.6.0 118 i586
=Sum: Window manager configuration
+Des:
This package allows creation, in one step, of the configuration files
for the fvwm, fvwm2, fvwm95, bowman, afterstep, cdesim, mwm, ctwm,
KDE, and icewm window managers.


In the menus, you will only find programs that are really installed in
the system. The desktop of the window managers will look the
same (considering the particularities of the window managers).


For KDE, mwm, ctwm, and icewm, there is only support for keeping the menus up
to date since these are very different from the other window managers,
like fvwm.


The icons used in the fvwm2 / fvwm95 menus are taken from the package
3dpixms which themselves are generated from the 3dpixm package.

This version of syslogd is similar to the standard Berkeley
product, but with a number of compatible extensions.  The
klogd daemon runs either independently or as a client of syslogd.


Klogd 'listens' to kernel log messages, prioritizes them, and
routes them to either output files or to syslogd.  This
version of klogd will optionally translate kernel addresses
to their symbolic equivalents if provided with a system map.

=Pkg: xntp 4.1.1 79 i586
=Sum: Network Time Protocol daemon (version 4)
+Des:
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a
computer client or server to another server or reference time source, such
as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides client accuracies
typically within a millisecond on LANs and up to a few tens of milliseconds
on WANs relative to a primary server synchronized to Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC) via a Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for
example. Typical NTP configurations utilize multiple redundant servers and
diverse network paths, to achieve high accuracy and reliability.
Some configurations include cryptographic authentication to prevent
accidental or malicious protocol attacks.

ntpd is an operating system daemon which sets and maintains the system
time-of-day synchronized with Internet standard time servers. ntpd is a
complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but
also retains compatibility with version 3, as defined by RFC-1305, and version
1 and 2, as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively. ntpd does
most computations in 64-bit floating point arithmetic and does relatively
clumsy 64-bit fixed point operations only when necessary to preserve the
ultimate precision, about 232 picoseconds. While the ultimate precision is not
achievable with ordinary workstations and networks of today, it may be
required with future nanosecond CPU clocks and gigabit LANs.

The daemon can operate in any of several modes, including symmetrical
active/passive, client/server broadcast/multicast, and manycast. A
broadcast/multicast or manycast client can discover remote servers, compute
server-client propagation delay correction factors, and configure itself
automatically. This makes it possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without
specifying configuration details specific to the local environment.

Ordinarily, ntpd reads the ntp.conf configuration file at start-up time
to determine the synchronization sources and operating modes. It is also
possible to specify a working, although limited, configuration entirely on the
command line, obviating the need for a configuration file. This may be
particularly appropriate when the local host is to be configured as a
broadcast/multicast client or manycast client, with all peers being determined
by listening to broadcasts at run time.

Various internal ntpd variables can be displayed and configuration options
altered while the daemon is running using the ntpq and ntpdc utility
programs.

=Pkg: SuSEfirewall2 2.1 124 noarch
=Sum: Packetfilter using 2.4 kernel's iptables/netfilter
+Des:
This package is the successor of the SuSEfirewall (firewals) package.
Like SuSEfirewall, SuSEfirewall2 implements a packetfilter to allow
system administrators to protect their computer and network by restricting
the possibilities of other hosts to connect to them. This potentially
saves you from suffering under the design flaws and vulnerabilties
that are found from time to time in various daemons.

Unlike the old ipchains based SuSEfirewall, this version uses the new
iptables/netfilter packet filtering infrastructure that comes with 2.4
kernels. It allows even more flexible rule setup and, specifically, the
creation of a stateful firewall, as it keeps track of connections and 
has the notion of related connections.

Note that for simply protecting a single host from attacks, you're probably
best of using the personal-firewall that comes with SuSE Linux.

Note that the old SuSEfirewall can also be run on 2.4 kernels, as there is
support for the old ipchains based rules in 2.4. SuSEfirewall2 can coexist
with SuSEfirewall. This may be useful for configurations, where you
sometimes boot 2.2 and sometimes 2.4 kernels. The SuSEfirewall scripts will
detect if SuSEfirewall2 is installed and enabled and if a 2.4 kernel is
running and in such a case will just not start SuSEfirewall, resulting in
SuSEfirewall2 to be active.

=Pkg: apache 1.3.26 12 i586
=Sum: The Apache Web server
+Des:
The Apache HTTP server. Very few programs have spread so quickly and
attracted such a large following in such a short time as this HTTP
server.  According to Netcraft, Apache runs on about 49.05%% of all
servers attached to the Internet. That represents about 1,182,142
systems. It has replaced within only a few months the NCSA server
which, until then was the unchallenged favorite.  This is undoubtedly
because Apache was derived from the NCSA server sources and that its
configuration is compatible to that of NCSA/1.3.


The Apache project was established to provide a forum for the
development of a freely available HTTP server. The goal is to develop
a secure, efficient, and easily extendable server, which also closely
parallels the development of the HTTP protocol. Thus Apache became a
replacement to NCSA/1.3.


Besides better performance, the removal of known errors, and better
conformance to HTTP standards (HTTP/1.1), Apache offers the following
useful features, which are often missing in other servers:


* password files, used to protect documents from unauthorized access, can
be indexed in various ways. The search for an entry is as a result more
efficient than in ordinary text files.


* client-request errors can be responded to in a flexible manner. CGI
scripts can be used to analyze the error and generate more informative
replies to both the client and the administrator than the HTTP status
codes offer.


* there is no restriction on aliasing and redirection. The Alias and
Redirect directives can be used in arbitrary number and depth.


* Apache can choose the best representation of a resource based on the
browser-supplied preferences for media type, languages, character set and
encoding ("Content Negotiation").


* with Apache you can implement several virtual servers. Thus requests to
different IP addresses (referring to the same computer) can be
distinguished and, depending on the IP address, appropriately handled.


Further advantages are the module concept and the well-documented API
(Application Programmers Interface). Extensions are easily developed and
new features are easily integrated into the server. For example,
an implementation of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) from Netscape exists for
Apache. This permits secure communication between server and client.

Apache is installed in the following directories:

/etc/httpd                      -> configuration files

/usr/sbin/httpd                 -> server binary

/var/log/httpd/                 -> protocol files

/var/run/httpd.pid              -> server PID

/srv/www                        -> server root

/etc/init.d/apache              -> Start/Stop script

packages, since the person building the package is allowed to
specify various configuration options.

You should install Autoconf if you are developing software and you'd
like to use it to create shell scripts which will configure your
source code packages.

Note that the Autoconf package is not required for the end user who

The directory xmltok contains a low-level library for tokenizing
XML. The interface is documented in xmltok/xmltok.h.
The directory xmlparse contains an XML parser library which is built on
top of the xmltok library. The interface is documented in
xmlparse/xmlparse.h. The directory sample contains a simple example
program using this interface; sample/build.bat is a batch file to build
the example using Visual C++.
The directory xmlwf contains the xmlwf application, which uses the
xmlparse library. The arguments to xmlwf are one or more files which are
each to be checked for well-formedness. An option -d dir can be
specified; for each well-formed input file the corresponding canonical
XML will be written to dir/f, where f is the filename (without any path)
of the input file. A -x option will cause references to external general
entities to be processed. A -s option will make documents that are not
standalone cause an error (a document is considered standalone if either
it is intrinsically standalone because it has no external subset and no
references to parameter entities in the internal subset or it is
declared as standalone in the XML declaration).

From the README file:

Gnumeric is still a young program and it is advancing steadily.


This is a partial list of Features implemented in Gnumeric, we need
documentation for these:


- Autofill
Number autofill (computes delta, autofills from that)
String autofill (daynames, months are built in).
String+Number combo integer autofill
Formula autofill.


- Drag and drop selection.
Select an area and use the border to drag the
contents (shift/control/alt are modifiers to copy
or move)


- Selection
- Multiple selection is supported, hold down control
key to augment the existing selection (it might be
discotinuous).

- Walking selection
Use return/tab and shift-return/shift-tab to capture
information in a selection.

- Fill quickly a region with the same text: just enter
the text in a selection and press control-enter.


- Number formatting
- The formatting of numbers is very powerful, we do
emulate the Excel number formatting specification.

- Format rules: you can use rules to specify which
format to use

- Format colors: you can specify a color to format
with in the format.


- Column/Row resizing
- Drag the column/row division to adjust the column
and row dimenssions.

- To make changes to various columns/rows
simultaneously, select the columns and then change
the dimension of one of them.


- To edit the contents of a cell that already has a value,
press F2 key.


- When typing a formula, you can use the cursor keys to select
a cell or a cell range in the expression.  This will only
work if a cell name is valid at the cursor point.

To specify a cell range, just move to the start of the cell
range and then hold down the shift key while making the size
of the selection cursor bigger.


- An expression is evaluated constantly on top of the current
selection.  There is a number of pre-defined auto-compute
expressions, you can change this by right clicking on this
expression (it is on the bottom right corner)


- If you drag a selection with button 3 instead of button one
there is no default action, rather, a menu pops up with
a list of possible actions to perform.


- Gnumeric distinguishes regular text from formulas by preceding
formulas with an equal sign.  So to enter an expression you
have to enter for example: =1+2.


- Control-Space selects a column

- Control-A selects all

- SHift-Space selects the row.

- Selection-keys + control extend the selection to boundary of
worksheet.

- SHift-Backspace:  Collapses selection to active cell.

- Home: move to the beginning of the row.

- Control-Home: move to the cell A1

+Des:
SQL is the most popular database language in the world. MySQL is a
client/server implementation that consists of a server daemon mysqld
and many different client programs and libraries.

The main goals of MySQL are speed, robustness and ease of use. MySQL
was originally developed because the developers at TcX needed a SQL
server that could handle very large databases an order of magnitude
faster than what any database vendor could offer to them. They have now
been using MySQL since 1996 in an environment with more than 40 databases
containing 10,000 tables, of which more than 500 have more than 7 million
rows. This is about 100 gigabytes of mission-critical data.

The base upon which MySQL is built is a set of routines that have been
used in a highly demanding production environment for many years. While
MySQL is still in development, it already offers a rich and highly useful
function set.

The official way to pronounce MySQL is "My Ess Que Ell" (Not MY-SEQUEL).

This package does only contain the server-side programs.

Unix disks and printers from LAN Manager clients, Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 clients, Windows'95 clients, Windows NT clients
and OS/2 clients. There is also a Unix client program supplied as part of the suite which allows Unix users to use an ftp-like interface to access filespace and printers on any other SMB server.

Samba includes the following programs (in summary):

* smbd, the SMB server. This handles actual connections from clients.

* nmbd, the Netbios name server, which helps clients locate servers.

* smbclient, the Unix-hosted client program.

* smbrun, a little 'glue' program to help the server run external programs.

* testprns, a program to test server access to printers.

* testparm, a program to test the Samba configuration file for correctness.

* smb.conf, the Samba configuration file.

* smbprint, a sample script to allow a Unix host to use smbclient
  to print to an SMB server.

The suite is supplied with full source and is GPLed.
